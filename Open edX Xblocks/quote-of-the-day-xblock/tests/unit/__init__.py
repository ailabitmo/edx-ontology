# This package is intended to be used for unit tests - a type of test that only checks behavior of
# some particular model, isolating it from environment using mocks and stubs.
# Such tests are the easiest to write (compared to other types of tests, like integration and end-to-end)
# and run faster than anything else, but have smaller coverage impact and don't test actual use case (though some
# techniques can be employed to improve that)
